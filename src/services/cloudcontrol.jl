    cancel_resource_request(request_token; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Cancels the specified resource operation request. For more information, see Canceling
resource operation requests in the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide. Only
resource operations requests with a status of PENDING or IN_PROGRESS can be cancelled.

# Arguments
- `request_token`: The RequestToken of the ProgressEvent object returned by the resource
  operation request.

    create_resource(desired_state, type_name; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Creates the specified resource. For more information, see Creating a resource in the Amazon
Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide. After you have initiated a resource creation
request, you can monitor the progress of your request by calling GetResourceRequestStatus
using the RequestToken of the ProgressEvent type returned by CreateResource.

# Arguments
- `desired_state`: Structured data format representing the desired state of the resource,
  consisting of that resource's properties and their desired values.   Cloud Control API
  currently supports JSON as a structured data format.  Specify the desired state as one of
  the following:   A JSON blob   A local path containing the desired state in JSON data
  format   For more information, see Composing the desired state of the resource in the
  Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide. For more information about the properties
  of a specific resource, refer to the related topic for the resource in the Resource and
  property types reference in the Amazon Web Services CloudFormation Users Guide.
- `type_name`: The name of the resource type.

# Keyword Parameters
- `client_token`: A unique identifier to ensure the idempotency of the resource request. As
  a best practice, specify this token to ensure idempotency, so that Amazon Web Services
  Cloud Control API can accurately distinguish between request retries and new resource
  requests. You might retry a resource request to ensure that it was successfully received. A
  client token is valid for 36 hours once used. After that, a resource request with the same
  client token is treated as a new request. If you do not specify a client token, one is
  generated for inclusion in the request. For more information, see Ensuring resource
  operation requests are unique in the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide.
- `role_arn`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Identity and Access Management (IAM)
  for Cloud Control API to use when performing this resource operation. The role specified
  must have the permissions required for this operation. The necessary permissions for each
  event handler are defined in the  handlers  section of the resource type definition schema.
  If you do not specify a role, Cloud Control API uses a temporary session created using your
  Amazon Web Services user credentials. For more information, see Specifying credentials in
  the Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User Guide.
- `type_version_id`: For private resource types, the type version to use in this resource
  operation. If you do not specify a resource version, CloudFormation uses the default
  version.

    delete_resource(identifier, type_name; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

request, you can monitor the progress of your request by calling GetResourceRequestStatus
using the RequestToken of the ProgressEvent returned by DeleteResource.

# Arguments
- `identifier`: The identifier for the resource. You can specify the primary identifier, or
  any secondary identifier defined for the resource type in its resource schema. You can only
  specify one identifier. Primary identifiers can be specified as a string or JSON; secondary
  identifiers must be specified as JSON. For compound primary identifiers (that is, one that
  consists of multiple resource properties strung together), to specify the primary
  identifier as a string, list the property values in the order they are specified in the
  primary identifier definition, separated by |.  For more information, see Identifying

  results, the response object's NextToken parameter value is set to a token. To retrieve the
