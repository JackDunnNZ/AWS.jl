"""
    create_partner_event_source(account, name; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Called by an SaaS partner to create a partner event source. This operation is not used by
Amazon Web Services customers. Each partner event source can be used by one Amazon Web
Services account to create a matching partner event bus in that Amazon Web Services
account. A SaaS partner must create one partner event source for each Amazon Web Services
account that wants to receive those event types.  A partner event source creates events
based on resources within the SaaS partner's service or application. An Amazon Web Services
account that creates a partner event bus that matches the partner event source can use that
event bus to receive events from the partner, and then process them using Amazon Web
Services Events rules and targets. Partner event source names follow this format:
partner_name/event_namespace/event_name    partner_name is determined during partner
registration and identifies the partner to Amazon Web Services customers. event_namespace
is determined by the partner and is a way for the partner to categorize their events.
event_name is determined by the partner, and should uniquely identify an event-generating
resource within the partner system. The combination of event_namespace and event_name
should help Amazon Web Services customers decide whether to create an event bus to receive
these events.

# Arguments
- `account`: The Amazon Web Services account ID that is permitted to create a matching
  partner event bus for this partner event source.
- `name`: The name of the partner event source. This name must be unique and must be in the
  format  partner_name/event_namespace/event_name . The Amazon Web Services account that
  wants to use this partner event source must create a partner event bus with a name that
  matches the name of the partner event source.

    put_permission(; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Running PutPermission permits the specified Amazon Web Services account or Amazon Web
Services organization to put events to the specified event bus. Amazon EventBridge
(CloudWatch Events) rules in your account are triggered by these events arriving to an
event bus in your account.  For another account to send events to your account, that
external account must have an EventBridge rule with your account's event bus as a target.
To enable multiple Amazon Web Services accounts to put events to your event bus, run
PutPermission once for each of these accounts. Or, if all the accounts are members of the
same Amazon Web Services organization, you can run PutPermission once specifying Principal
as \"*\" and specifying the Amazon Web Services organization ID in Condition, to grant
permissions to all accounts in that organization. If you grant permissions using an
organization, then accounts in that organization must specify a RoleArn with proper
permissions when they use PutTarget to add your account's event bus as a target. For more
information, see Sending and Receiving Events Between Amazon Web Services Accounts in the
Amazon EventBridge User Guide. The permission policy on the event bus cannot exceed 10 KB
in size.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a keyword argument. Valid keys are:
- `"action"`: The action that you are enabling the other account to perform.
- `"condition"`: This parameter enables you to limit the permission to accounts that
  fulfill a certain condition, such as being a member of a certain Amazon Web Services
  organization. For more information about Amazon Web Services Organizations, see What Is
  Amazon Web Services Organizations in the Amazon Web Services Organizations User Guide. If
  you specify Condition with an Amazon Web Services organization ID, and specify \"*\" as the
  value for Principal, you grant permission to all the accounts in the named organization.
  The Condition is a JSON string which must contain Type, Key, and Value fields.
- `"event_bus_name"`: The name of the event bus associated with the rule. If you omit this,
  the default event bus is used.
- `"policy"`: A JSON string that describes the permission policy statement. You can include
  a Policy parameter in the request instead of using the StatementId, Action, Principal, or
  Condition parameters.
- `"principal"`: The 12-digit Amazon Web Services account ID that you are permitting to put
  events to your default event bus. Specify \"*\" to permit any account to put events to your
  default event bus. If you specify \"*\" without specifying Condition, avoid creating rules
  that may match undesirable events. To create more secure rules, make sure that the event
  pattern for each rule contains an account field with a specific account ID from which to
  receive events. Rules with an account field do not match any events sent from other
  accounts.
- `"statement_id"`: An identifier string for the external account that you are granting
  permissions to. If you later want to revoke the permission for this external account,
  specify this StatementId when you run RemovePermission.

"""
    put_rule(name; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Creates or updates the specified rule. Rules are enabled by default, or based on value of
the state. You can disable a rule using DisableRule. A single rule watches for events from
a single event bus. Events generated by Amazon Web Services services go to your account's
default event bus. Events generated by SaaS partner services or applications go to the
matching partner event bus. If you have custom applications or services, you can specify
whether their events go to your default event bus or a custom event bus that you have
created. For more information, see CreateEventBus. If you are updating an existing rule,
the rule is replaced with what you specify in this PutRule command. If you omit arguments
in PutRule, the old values for those arguments are not kept. Instead, they are replaced
with null values. When you create or update a rule, incoming events might not immediately
start matching to new or updated rules. Allow a short period of time for changes to take
effect. A rule must contain at least an EventPattern or ScheduleExpression. Rules with
EventPatterns are triggered when a matching event is observed. Rules with
ScheduleExpressions self-trigger based on the given schedule. A rule can have both an
EventPattern and a ScheduleExpression, in which case the rule triggers on matching events
as well as on a schedule. When you initially create a rule, you can optionally assign one
or more tags to the rule. Tags can help you organize and categorize your resources. You can
also use them to scope user permissions, by granting a user permission to access or change
only rules with certain tag values. To use the PutRule operation and assign tags, you must
have both the events:PutRule and events:TagResource permissions. If you are updating an
existing rule, any tags you specify in the PutRule operation are ignored. To update the
tags of an existing rule, use TagResource and UntagResource. Most services in Amazon Web
Services treat : or / as the same character in Amazon Resource Names (ARNs). However,
EventBridge uses an exact match in event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the correct ARN
characters when creating event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in the event you
want to match. In EventBridge, it is possible to create rules that lead to infinite loops,
where a rule is fired repeatedly. For example, a rule might detect that ACLs have changed
on an S3 bucket, and trigger software to change them to the desired state. If the rule is
not written carefully, the subsequent change to the ACLs fires the rule again, creating an
infinite loop. To prevent this, write the rules so that the triggered actions do not
re-fire the same rule. For example, your rule could fire only if ACLs are found to be in a
bad state, instead of after any change.  An infinite loop can quickly cause higher than
expected charges. We recommend that you use budgeting, which alerts you when charges exceed
your specified limit. For more information, see Managing Your Costs with Budgets.

# Arguments
- `name`: The name of the rule that you are creating or updating.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a keyword argument. Valid keys are:
- `"description"`: A description of the rule.
- `"event_bus_name"`: The name or ARN of the event bus to associate with this rule. If you

- `"event_pattern"`: The event pattern. For more information, see Events and Event Patterns
  in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide.
- `"role_arn"`: The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role associated with the rule. If
  you're setting an event bus in another account as the target and that account granted
  permission to your account through an organization instead of directly by the account ID,
  you must specify a RoleArn with proper permissions in the Target structure, instead of here
  in this parameter.
- `"schedule_expression"`: The scheduling expression. For example, \"cron(0 20 * * ? *)\"
  or \"rate(5 minutes)\".
- `"state"`: Indicates whether the rule is enabled or disabled.
- `"tags"`: The list of key-value pairs to associate with the rule.

Amazon API Gateway REST API endpoints   API Gateway   Batch job queue   CloudWatch Logs
group   CodeBuild project   CodePipeline   Amazon EC2 CreateSnapshot API call   Amazon EC2
RebootInstances API call   Amazon EC2 StopInstances API call   Amazon EC2
TerminateInstances API call   Amazon ECS tasks   Event bus in a different Amazon Web
Services account or Region. You can use an event bus in the US East (N. Virginia)
us-east-1, US West (Oregon) us-west-2, or Europe (Ireland) eu-west-1 Regions as a target
for a rule.   Firehose delivery stream (Kinesis Data Firehose)   Inspector assessment
template (Amazon Inspector)   Kinesis stream (Kinesis Data Stream)   Lambda function
Redshift clusters (Data API statement execution)   Amazon SNS topic   Amazon SQS queues
(includes FIFO queues   SSM Automation   SSM OpsItem   SSM Run Command   Step Functions
state machines   Creating rules with built-in targets is supported only in the Management
Console. The built-in targets are EC2 CreateSnapshot API call, EC2 RebootInstances API
call, EC2 StopInstances API call, and EC2 TerminateInstances API call.  For some target
types, PutTargets provides target-specific parameters. If the target is a Kinesis data
stream, you can optionally specify which shard the event goes to by using the
KinesisParameters argument. To invoke a command on multiple EC2 instances with one rule,
you can use the RunCommandParameters field. To be able to make API calls against the
resources that you own, Amazon EventBridge needs the appropriate permissions. For Lambda
and Amazon SNS resources, EventBridge relies on resource-based policies. For EC2 instances,
Kinesis Data Streams, Step Functions state machines and API Gateway REST APIs, EventBridge
relies on IAM roles that you specify in the RoleARN argument in PutTargets. For more
information, see Authentication and Access Control in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide. If
another Amazon Web Services account is in the same region and has granted you permission
(using PutPermission), you can send events to that account. Set that account's event bus as
a target of the rules in your account. To send the matched events to the other account,
specify that account's event bus as the Arn value when you run PutTargets. If your account
sends events to another account, your account is charged for each sent event. Each event
sent to another account is charged as a custom event. The account receiving the event is
not charged. For more information, see Amazon EventBridge Pricing.   Input, InputPath, and
InputTransformer are not available with PutTarget if the target is an event bus of a
different Amazon Web Services account.  If you are setting the event bus of another account
as the target, and that account granted permission to your account through an organization
instead of directly by the account ID, then you must specify a RoleArn with proper
permissions in the Target structure. For more information, see Sending and Receiving Events
Between Amazon Web Services Accounts in the Amazon EventBridge User Guide. For more
information about enabling cross-account events, see PutPermission.  Input, InputPath, and
InputTransformer are mutually exclusive and optional parameters of a target. When a rule is
triggered due to a matched event:   If none of the following arguments are specified for a
target, then the entire event is passed to the target in JSON format (unless the target is
Amazon EC2 Run Command or Amazon ECS task, in which case nothing from the event is passed
to the target).   If Input is specified in the form of valid JSON, then the matched event
is overridden with this constant.   If InputPath is specified in the form of JSONPath (for
example, .detail), then only the part of the event specified in the path is passed to the
target (for example, only the detail part of the event is passed).   If InputTransformer is
specified, then one or more specified JSONPaths are extracted from the event and used as
values in a template that you specify as the input to the target.   When you specify
InputPath or InputTransformer, you must use JSON dot notation, not bracket notation. When
you add targets to a rule and the associated rule triggers soon after, new or updated
targets might not be immediately invoked. Allow a short period of time for changes to take
effect. This action can partially fail if too many requests are made at the same time. If
that happens, FailedEntryCount is non-zero in the response and each entry in FailedEntries
provides the ID of the failed target and the error code.

associated with the account when you granted it permission with PutPermission. You can find
the StatementId by using DescribeEventBus.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a keyword argument. Valid keys are:
- `"event_bus_name"`: The name of the event bus to revoke permissions for. If you omit
  this, the default event bus is used.
- `"remove_all_permissions"`: Specifies whether to remove all permissions.

Removes the specified targets from the specified rule. When the rule is triggered, those

triggers, removed targets might continue to be invoked. Allow a short period of time for
changes to take effect. This action can partially fail if too many requests are made at the
same time. If that happens, FailedEntryCount is non-zero in the response and each entry in
FailedEntries provides the ID of the failed target and the error code.

# Arguments
- `ids`: The IDs of the targets to remove from the rule.
- `rule`: The name of the rule.

# Optional Parameters
Optional parameters can be passed as a keyword argument. Valid keys are:
- `"event_bus_name"`: The name or ARN of the event bus associated with the rule. If you
  omit this, the default event bus is used.
- `"force"`: If this is a managed rule, created by an Amazon Web Services service on your
  behalf, you must specify Force as True to remove targets. This parameter is ignored for
  rules that are not managed rules. You can check whether a rule is a managed rule by using
  DescribeRule or ListRules and checking the ManagedBy field of the response.

    start_replay(destination, event_end_time, event_source_arn, event_start_time, replay_name; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Starts the specified replay. Events are not necessarily replayed in the exact same order
that they were added to the archive. A replay processes events to replay based on the time
in the event, and replays them using 1 minute intervals. If you specify an EventStartTime
and an EventEndTime that covers a 20 minute time range, the events are replayed from the
first minute of that 20 minute range first. Then the events from the second minute are
replayed. You can use DescribeReplay to determine the progress of a replay. The value
returned for EventLastReplayedTime indicates the time within the specified time range
associated with the last event replayed.

# Arguments
- `destination`: A ReplayDestination object that includes details about the destination for
  the replay.
- `event_end_time`: A time stamp for the time to stop replaying events. Only events that
  occurred between the EventStartTime and EventEndTime are replayed.
- `event_source_arn`: The ARN of the archive to replay events from.
- `event_start_time`: A time stamp for the time to start replaying events. Only events that
  occurred between the EventStartTime and EventEndTime are replayed.
- `replay_name`: The name of the replay to start.

# Optional Parameters

Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified EventBridge resource. Tags can
help you organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user
permissions by granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain
tag values. In EventBridge, rules and event buses can be tagged. Tags don't have any
semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of
characters. You can use the TagResource action with a resource that already has tags. If
you specify a new tag key, this tag is appended to the list of tags associated with the
resource. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the resource, the new
tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag. You can associate as
many as 50 tags with a resource.

# Arguments
- `resource_arn`: The ARN of the EventBridge resource that you're adding tags to.

However, EventBridge uses an exact match in event patterns and rules. Be sure to use the
correct ARN characters when creating event patterns so that they match the ARN syntax in
the event you want to match.

# Arguments

  follow the format specified in Amazon Web Services Events, and the following fields are
  mandatory:    id     account     source     time     region     resources     detail-type
