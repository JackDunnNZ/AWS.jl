    create_app_monitor(domain, name; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Creates a Amazon CloudWatch RUM app monitor, which collects telemetry data from your
application and sends that data to RUM. The data includes performance and reliability
information such as page load time, client-side errors, and user behavior. You use this
operation only to create a new app monitor. To update an existing app monitor, use
UpdateAppMonitor instead. After you create an app monitor, sign in to the CloudWatch RUM
console to get the JavaScript code snippet to add to your web application. For more
information, see How do I find a code snippet that I've already generated?

# Arguments
- `domain`: The top-level internet domain name for which your application has
  administrative authority.
- `name`: A name for the app monitor.

# Keyword Parameters
- `app_monitor_configuration`: A structure that contains much of the configuration data for
  the app monitor. If you are using Amazon Cognito for authorization, you must include this
  structure in your request, and it must include the ID of the Amazon Cognito identity pool
  to use for authorization. If you don't include AppMonitorConfiguration, you must set up
  your own authorization method. For more information, see Authorize your application to send
  data to Amazon Web Services. If you omit this argument, the sample rate used for RUM is set
  to 10% of the user sessions.
- `cw_log_enabled`: Data collected by RUM is kept by RUM for 30 days and then deleted. This
  parameter specifies whether RUM sends a copy of this telemetry data to Amazon CloudWatch
  Logs in your account. This enables you to keep the telemetry data for more than 30 days,
  but it does incur Amazon CloudWatch Logs charges. If you omit this parameter, the default
  is false.
- `tags`: Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the app monitor. Tags can help you
  organize and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by
  granting a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values. Tags
  don't have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as
  strings of characters.  &lt;p&gt;You can associate as many as 50 tags with an app
  monitor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For more information, see &lt;a
  href=&quot;https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html&quot;&gt;Tagging
  Amazon Web Services resources&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

- `time_range`: A structure that defines the time range that you want to retrieve results
  from.

# Keyword Parameters

    put_rum_events(app_monitor_details, batch_id, id, rum_events, user_details; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Sends telemetry events about your application performance and user behavior to CloudWatch
RUM. The code snippet that RUM generates for you to add to your application includes
PutRumEvents operations to send this data to RUM. Each PutRumEvents operation can send a
batch of events from one user session.

# Arguments
- `app_monitor_details`: A structure that contains information about the app monitor that
  collected this telemetry information.
- `batch_id`: A unique identifier for this batch of RUM event data.
- `id`: The ID of the app monitor that is sending this data.

    tag_resource(resource_arn, tags; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Assigns one or more tags (key-value pairs) to the specified CloudWatch RUM resource.
Currently, the only resources that can be tagged app monitors. Tags can help you organize
and categorize your resources. You can also use them to scope user permissions by granting
a user permission to access or change only resources with certain tag values. Tags don't
have any semantic meaning to Amazon Web Services and are interpreted strictly as strings of
characters. You can use the TagResource action with a resource that already has tags. If
you specify a new tag key for the resource, this tag is appended to the list of tags
associated with the alarm. If you specify a tag key that is already associated with the
resource, the new tag value that you specify replaces the previous value for that tag. You
can associate as many as 50 tags with a resource. For more information, see Tagging Amazon
Web Services resources.

# Arguments
- `resource_arn`: The ARN of the CloudWatch RUM resource that you're adding tags to.
- `tags`: The list of key-value pairs to associate with the resource.

"""
    update_app_monitor(name; aws_config::AbstractAWSConfig=global_aws_config(), kwargs...)

Updates the configuration of an existing app monitor. When you use this operation, only the
parts of the app monitor configuration that you specify in this operation are changed. For
any parameters that you omit, the existing values are kept. You can't use this operation to
change the tags of an existing app monitor. To change the tags of an existing app monitor,
use TagResource. To create a new app monitor, use CreateAppMonitor. After you update an app
monitor, sign in to the CloudWatch RUM console to get the updated JavaScript code snippet
to add to your web application. For more information, see How do I find a code snippet that
